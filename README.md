# Code_School_JavaScript

Code School is an intensive nine-week course for students who are interested in jumpstarting their web programming careers. Interaction with the local industry is facilitated by Code School, and many participants are placed in internships and jobs within the software and web industries upon completing the course.

During the second week attending Code School, I learned more about JavaScript and had a chance to advance my skills in programing and problem solving. 

I created two simple web applications:
- Math Quiz: give the user an equation, get the user's answer, and check if the answer is correct.
- Tic Tac Toe: build the classic Tic Tac Toe game, the purpose is to understand what's behind the game and how it works, rather than creating the game itself.

and a version of the popular 2048 game. 

For the 2048 game, I was challenged and learned how to break a complicated web application down into smaller pieces, come up with a solution for each one of them, and put them together to finsih the whole project. Not only that I learned a lot more about object, array, function, statements, and loops, but I also had the opportunity to advance my knowledge in working with an API. For this version of the 2048 game, the users can submit their scores so they could be saved to the server, and can view the scores in the leaderboard, which is displayed by loading all high scores and players' name from the server.
